# Using_Weather_Data_to_Boost_Bike_Share_Demand_Forecasting 

Author: Giuseppe Cappella

This project merges data from bike share stations in Washington DC with meteorological data over a time span that covers 10 years. The goal is to develop an extensive MongoDB dataframe suitable for subsequent analyses. Furthermore,this data will be employed to analyze and understand the impact of weather conditions on bike share usage, enhancing the dataset's richness and the accuracy of demand forecasting. The project specifically compares two approaches using Prophet: one that incorporates weather regressors and one that does not, to evaluate their effectiveness in improving service demand predictions within the forecasting model.

## Data Sources

For the bike sharing station data, this project utilizes CSV files made available by Capital Bikeshare, covering Washington DC from 2013 to 2023. These files will be integrated to create a singular, comprehensive CSV file that consolidates bike share usage data over the specified period. As for the meteorological data, the source is OpenWeatherMap, which provides detailed weather information for Washington DC.

**NB: the Capital bike share data can be downloaded at the following link : https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data in the "Trip History Data" section. The 10 years Weather data are present in the repo as a csv file (2d8242457dbe0baa13874aac40efb970.csv)**
